### Description (from [CodeGym | Game Tasks ~ Mine Picker](https://codegym.cc/projects/games/com.codegym.games.minesweeper))
About 10 years ago, an omen appeared in offices everywhere: if an employee is staring too intently at his screen and occasionally clicks with the mouse with the same intensity, he's most likely playing Minesweeper.

For anyone who has forgotten, and for others who missed this era due to their age: Minesweeper is one of the most popular office games that shipped with Microsoft Windows. Even today, if you're sitting at a computer running this operating system, Minesweeper is either pre-installed (just type "Minesweeper" in the Windows search box) or you can download it free from the Microsoft Store. Many Linux builds, such as KDE and GNOME, also acquired similar games.

Unlike most other "time killers", this game presents the perfect balances of logical moves and random moves, making Minesweeper very exciting and simultaneously... somewhat less pointless than other such games.

So, we have a game board divided into squares. Some of them contain "mines", but we don't know how many there are or where they are. Our goal is to reveal all of the unmined squares without getting blown up. You reveal a square with a left click. If it doesn't contain a mine, then a number appears that represents the number of mines adjacent to the revealed space. Now you need to do some thinking and guess which cells can be revealed and which should be marked as mined. And so it continues until you win or explode.

Windows developers created this toy to help humans learn to use the mouse (yes, there was a time when computers didn't have mice and you had to be content with just the keyboard). Actually, the history of Minesweeper stretches farther back than even Microsoft. Its predecessors were available on mainframes as early as the sixties of the last centuryâ€¦

But we digress... Right now, we're talking about creating our own version of Minesweeper!  The rules for our "probabilistic brainteaser" will be exactly those described above. We've already divided this difficult task into subtasks on CodeGym and we'll tell you what to do. Be brave.
